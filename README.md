# Design and Verification using Verilog HDL
# ðŸ“Œ Overview
Verilog HDL implementations of combinational and sequential circuits, including basic digital design modules and test examples. It covers all the Combinational and Sequential circuits. Each project includes RTL design, testbenches, and simulation results to demonstrate the complete design and verification flow.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Learn digital design using Verilog HDL.

Implement fundamental and advanced digital circuits.

Develop testbenches for functional verification.

Analyze simulation results using waveform viewers.

RTL Code (.v) â†’ Contains the Verilog design files.

Testbench (.v) â†’ Contains testbenches for verification.

Waveform/Logs â†’ Simulation results.
