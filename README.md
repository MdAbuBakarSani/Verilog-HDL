# Verilog-HDL
Verilog HDL implementations of combinational and sequential circuits, including basic digital design modules and test examples.

## 🔹 Combinational Circuits
- Half Adder ✅ Design Only 
- Full Adder ✅ Design Only 
- Multiplexer ✅ Design Only 
- Decoder ✅ Design Only 
- Comparator ✅ Design Only

## 🔹 Sequential Circuits
- Flip-Flops (SR, D, JK, T) → Design only
- Counters (Synchronous & Asynchronous) → Design Only
- Shift Registers → Design Only
- Simple FSMs (Finite State Machines) → Design Only
